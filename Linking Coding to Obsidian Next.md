## Lets try
Knowing the ln command to link files in linux lets look it up for macos

we will probably try a symbolic link
-s for symbolic

and we'll want to link our jupyter folder to our obsidian folder (/Users/crest/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-Crest@koemel.net-folder/Obsidian/Billy/Coding)

so

```
ln -s /Users/crest/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-Crest@koemel.net-folder/Coding /Users/crest/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-Crest@koemel.net-folder/Obsidian/Billy/Coding
```

Lets try it

Well that just worked. Pretty Easy wow, thats great.
