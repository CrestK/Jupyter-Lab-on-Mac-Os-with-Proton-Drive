## Lets try
We have jupyter lab open up to a specific directory, lets link that directory to our obsidian vault so that we can see the files dynamically link them while we write notes.


Knowing the ln command to link files in linux lets look it up for macos

we will probably try a symbolic link
-s for symbolic

and we'll want to link our jupyter folder to our obsidian folder (/Users/crest/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-Crest@koemel.net-folder/Obsidian/Billy/Coding)

so

```
ln -s /Users/crest/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-Crest@koemel.net-folder/Coding /Users/crest/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-Crest@koemel.net-folder/Obsidian/Billy/Coding
```

Lets try it

Well that just worked. Pretty Easy wow, thats great.
